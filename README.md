# READ ME
Quizlet's decided to become a lil greedy bitch, so I said fuck that and decided to make my own thing.

I'll try to make it have the same features as quizlet eventualy. The thing that automatically fills stuff in will be a bit difficult though. (I might be able to make it work by implementing google translate? but we'll see) Also, sets won't be able to be shared online through the program, but it will be possible to export the set, and share it that way. I'll see if I can make a place to put up your sets for other people to use.
There will be an option to share sets through files though, once I figure out how to do that.

If there are any issues or suggestions, I would appreciate it if you'd let me know.

I also assume it currently doesn't work on anything other than windows, but I'll make sure that gets fixed in the near future.

# HOW TO INSTALL
I know github can be a little confusing to navigate, so I'll give you a quick rundown:
### 1. Go to the releases page
There's a section on the right labeled "Releases". Click it.
### 2. Download it
The latest release should be on the top and have the word "latest" next to it (for now "latest" might be replaced by "pre-release").
Click the top zip file to download it. The source code isn't important unless you want make changes to the program.
### 3. Extract the files
Right click the file in file explorer and click extract.
### 4. Open the .exe file
Not UnityCrashHandler64.exe. That thing is useless for all you care, plus it doesn't actually do anything when you open it.
