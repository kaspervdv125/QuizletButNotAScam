# READ ME
This is a program comparable to quizlet, except it's free and has less features.

It's only been tested on Windows so far. There is a Mac version but it most likely won't work.

### Some FYI's on using the program
  - Pressing Escape at any point will bring you back to the main menu. Do note that going back to the main menu does not save anything.
  - When creating a learnset, you can press Insert to add a line and Del to remove a line.
  - Del always removes the lowest line, so if you want to remove line 3, for example, and you're on line 13, it would likely be easier to do this in the file when you save the learnset.
  - If you enter the same term on 2 different lines, things will break. This is an issue that will be fixed, but for now just avoid having 2 of the same terms.
  - In the same area, when pressing Home when no textfields are selected, it saves the current learnset to a file stored in the program's _Data folder.
  - If you want to change the title of a learnset after it has been saved, change both the file's name and the text between <title> and </title>.
  - While learning a set, you can press Home to change if the term or the definition gets asked.
  

# HOW TO INSTALL
I know GitHub can be a little confusing to navigate, so I'll give you a quick rundown:
### 1. Go to the releases page
There's a section on the right labeled "Releases". Click it.
### 2. Download it
The latest release should be on the top and have the word "latest" next to it.
Click the top zip file to download it. The source code isn't important unless you want to make changes to the program.
### 3. Extract the files
Right-click the file in file explorer and click extract.
### 4. Open the program
For the Windows version, it's Wurm.exe, not UnityCrashHandler64.exe (that thing's useless for all you care, plus it doesn't actually do anything when you try to open it).
