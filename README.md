Quizlet's decided to become a lil greedy bitch, so I said fuck that and decided to make my own thing.

I'll try to make it have the same features as quizlet eventualy, but it of course won't be able to automatically fill in words when creating a learning set, or share sets online (unless someone who knows something about servers can help me out with either of these things).

There will be an option to share sets through files though, once I figure out how to do that.

If there are any issues or suggestions, I would appreciate it if you'd let me know.
