Quizlet's decided to become a lil greedy bitch, so I said fuck that and decided to make my own thing.

I'll try to make it have the same features as quizlet eventualy. The thing that automatically fills stuff in will be a bit difficult though. (I might be able to make it work by implementing google translate? but we'll see) Also, sets won't be able to be shared online through the program, but it will be possible to export the set, and share it that way. I'll see if I can make a place to put up your sets for other people to use.
There will be an option to share sets through files though, once I figure out how to do that.

If you found any issues or have suggestions, please let me know in the issue tab at the top. 

It has currently only been tested on Windows, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are more issues in the MacOS build than in the Windows build

### Some FYI's on using the program
  - Pressing escape at any point will bring you back to the main menu. Do note that going back to the main menu does not save anything.
  - When creating a learset, you can press Insert to add a line and Del to remove a line.
  - Del always removes the lowest line, so if you want to remove line 3 for example, and you're on line 13, it would likely be easier to do this in the file when you save the learnset.
  - If you enter the same term on 2 different lines, things will break. This is an issue that will be fixed, but for now just avoid having 2 of the same terms.
  - In the same area, when pressing Home when no textfields are selected saves the current learnset to a file stored in the program's folder.
  - If you want to change the title of a learnset after it has been saved, change both the file's name and the text between <title> and </title>.
  - While learning a set, you can press Home to change if the term or the definition gets asked.
  

# HOW TO INSTALL
I know github can be a little confusing to navigate, so I'll give you a quick rundown:
### 1. Go to the releases page
There's a section on the right labeled "Releases". Click it.
### 2. Download it
The latest release should be on the top and have the word "latest" next to it (for now "latest" might be replaced by "pre-release").
Click the top zip file to download it. The source code isn't important unless you want make changes to the program.
### 3. Extract the files
Right click the file in file explorer and click extract.
### 4. Open the .exe file
Not UnityCrashHandler64.exe. That thing is useless for all you care, plus it doesn't actually do anything when you open it.
